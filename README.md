This data science product, **wecaredata**, adopts advanced machine learning techniques to bring you convenience for investigating the Reddit.com website. If you have something to say or want look for information you could input in the white space window, then push the button on the right to search. After you get the predicted result, click on the button or link to get the subreddit website. The image above shows what the interface look like.

The model was trained and deployed on AWS so that it only takes 1 second from taking your input to predicting/recommending the most relevant subreddit for you to post your topics. Feel free to give a try by clicking this webapp: http://www.wecaredata.com .

By this APP I hope to help reddit users to find the best place/community to post, comment and discuss. This app will allow people to share more thoughts and communicate better in an easier way.

Happy 21st century!
