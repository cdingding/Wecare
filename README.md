This data science product, **wecaredata**, is designed to bring you convenience for investigating the Reddit.com website. If you have something to say or want look for information you could input in the white space window, then push the button on the right. It will lead you to the most relevant subreddit on the Reddit website. The image above shows what the interface look like.

By this APP I hope to help reddit users to find the best place/community to post, comment and discuss. This app will allow people to share more thoughts and communicate better in an easier way.

I applied Naive Bayes model to help predict and recommend. Give a try by clicking website: http://www.wecaredata.com
